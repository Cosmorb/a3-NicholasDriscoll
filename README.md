Updated Readme: Quick update on resubmitting this assignment. While reviewing it for a different project where I was also applying this, I realized I didn't fully understand everything happening in the code. I think I relied heavily on VS Copilot for this assignment, and after going through it earlier this evening, I decided to reupload the assignment with my own modifications to the code, especially in parts I had more hands-on involvement with. I felt that during my last submission, Copilot was too controlling, completing entire sections of code when I was writing software, which went too far. After reviewing my actual code, I saw I didn't fully grasp what was happening compared to now, when I understand what I'm executing and why. In the code segments I linked sources for almost every function used within main.js and server.js—these were the main areas where I relied on VS Copilot. The HTML sections weren't really that challenging; they just sped up the process, and I could understand them easily. I'm planning to email the professor about this because I believe my last submission depended too much on VS Copilot, and I want to ensure all my assignments comply with our current AI policy. I’ve included links to my notes and comments on sections with more AI assistance than I think is acceptable. Outside of that, nothing else changed in the Readme. I also added one technical achievement I realized was a requirement I hadn't covered before.

Basic Requirements:

I met all of the basic requirements by including both server results and functionality in the server logic. The only part I don't think I completed was the derived field, as I wasn't sure what would fit within the needs of my application's design. Additionally, I had difficulty figuring out a way to generate a creation date to set a deadline based on priority, so I wasn't able to finish that. I also didn't want to just copy and paste from ChatGPT. However, I was able to create a website that I plan to use for future projects by setting up HTML pages that mainly connect to each other and display information I want future employers to see. Specifically, I created three pages: one for my contact information, one for the projects I want to showcase, and one for an about me section. While the contact page is mainly for this assignment, I believe the others serve as good introductions for future projects or assignments. I enjoy building my experience by expanding on what I've already done and modifying it, as I think that's the best way for me to learn. I completed almost all the deliverables as outlined in your readme, and you probably pulled this from the pull request to the original repo.


Technical Achievements:
So I created a try page app because I wanted to do more for this project and because I had an idea of how it would work. It took longer than expected, and I got caught up with National Guard responsibilities, but I was still able to create something that allows users to submit data, like a contact information sheet for potential employers, which then updates on the application.

Additionally, I created a priority button that inputs a set date for when I will respond. The user would select the priority level—high, low, or mid—and it would calculate a response date based on the creation date and the selected priority level.

For my CSS rules:
Again, I based this heavily on my A1 assignment and transferred what I did there to this project. I actually like how the website looks, including what I incorporated into it, and I plan to update it over time, but I ended up removing that style.

Design Achievements:
I wasn't able to contact anyone to test it because I was very busy this week with other projects and MQP. Honestly, I just didn't manage my time well for this assignment. However, I was able to create a free single-page application that includes a center for my projects and a YouTube video link. It has one page dedicated entirely to me and who I am, and the other page serving as the service side where employers can log in and send a message like, 'Hi, if you're interested, blah, blah, blah,' with the ability to delete those messages.



AI Use:
So, for AI use, compared to what I submitted earlier, this is much less because I relied more on websites and modifying code on those sites to fit my project requirements. I realized after reading it earlier this evening that I had been a bit too dependent on VS Co-Pilot for some parts. I wanted to ensure that it actually complies with the policy or class guidelines, and that I truly understood the code, since I plan to use this and other things we develop in this class for other projects outside of class. I thought it was important to be able to understand what I was doing, and before, I didn't quite have that feeling. Now, with what I've done and modified, along with some additional research on the topics I covered, I feel confident about my work. Most of the AI used is now in main.js and server.js, but they have been significantly simplified from their previous versions, making them easier for me to understand fluently than before. I did this because, after reading it, I realized I depended too much on VS Co-Pilot, and I wanted to make sure I understood what I was doing. Heavy AI use is noted in the comment sections, and there are links to most of the examples I used as the basis for the code, mainly from Stack Overflow and Mozilla.
